The symbols of cards are shown as corresponding letters:- Club-C, Spade-S, Diamond-D, Heard-H
and the number of the card before the above symbols:- A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K

To pick a card from deck you have to press: D  
to move a card from the 1-7 Pile - lets suppose you want to move the card from pile 4 to 5 we write 45.
If we want to move multiple cards between piles then 453 -> which means we move 3 cards from pile 4th position to 5th.

Moving card from 1-7 pile to the deck we mention the position of card and the deck we want to move it to 
Example: You want to move the card from 7th position to Club Deck, you will write: 7C.
